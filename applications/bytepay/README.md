## Project Overview ðŸ“„

### Overview
#### What is BytePay?
- Coding to earn! Sell opensource product as NFT!
- Bytepay is a platform that supports paid tasks to complete open-source tasks on Github. And the project owner or maintainer can sell the opensource product like (bin files apk etc.) as NFT. 
- You can create paid open-source tasks in issue. Those who complete the task as required can receive tokens after the pull request accepted. The owner can upload opensource product for example a bin file to bytepay, the consumer who need use the bin file need to buy the NFT and get the download permission.
#### Why BytePay
- So many open source developers are too poor!
- Developers can't support themselves through open-source, so they have to be hired by some companies
- Many excellent open-source projects have no business model.
#### Integration with Acala / Karura EVM+
- Bytepay supports payment in aUSD
- Bytepay supports decentralized transaction on Acala EVM+
- Bytepay supports opensource product owner to mint NFT on Karura

1. To verify the feasibility of Bytepay, we will heavily use it in our own open source project which has 8k+ stars and plan to attract 100 developers to participate. At the same time, our open source project will also be available for sale in Bytepay NFT market.
2. We plan to attract and select five open source projects as the early adopters, and then investigate their demand as well as the willingness to renew. We will carry out large-scale marketing and promotion for Bytepay if more than 40% of the adopters says yes to us.
