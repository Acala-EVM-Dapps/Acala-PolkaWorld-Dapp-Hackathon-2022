In order to build it into a representative project for equity markets, the team will take a long-term view of Chemix.

### Project Details

The mission of Chemix Ecosystem is to give all users who hold tokens to be released the opportunity to efficiently exchange assets and increase asset utilization, thereby reducing the risk of holding coins, and allowing other secondary market users to participate in private and public offerings.

### Ecosystem Fit

Chemix is an application that provides a formal auction of tokens. We target project parties, institutional parties, and institutional parties and users who got their shares in public offerings and private placements, and help project parties and institutional parties speed up the efficiency of the flow of money in their hands by auctioning their shares of tokens that they have not yet gotten their hands on.
Our application solves 2 needs.
1. Solve the need for trading between the first and second level markets.
2. Increase the liquidity of temporarily unreleased token shares to generate transaction value.
We call this need a level 1.5 market.
Subsequent users who receive auction shares can place their auction-acquired token interests on our exchange to trade them and continuously gain trading liquidity .
