# Hotpot 
A codeless DAO launching toolkit based on bonding curve


# Project Description

1. Inspiration

    Launching a DAO is not easy for newcomers in blockchain due to the technical difficulty of blockchain principles. Hotpot Network provides easy launching steps for people outside the blockchain world to start a DAO within a few clicks. Any newcomers can design their token economics with our user-friendly configuration interface to address the goals of different communities. Our platform consists of multi-chain support for smart contracts, a user-friendly web interface, SDK, and various toolboxes for different DAOs. Moreover, the platform itself is also a DAO, all the decisions and executions are supervised by the hotpot community.


2. Why we are different

    Hotpot is a blockchain-native DAO-launching platform. We guide users through an interactive, tutorial-style procedure to design token economics for DAOs. We use bonding curve, a general case of automated market maker algorithms for the token economics design. However, it is non-obvious for users to understand different key parameters in token economics design. Instead, we use an artificial intelligence-powered system to search the optimal bonding curve parameters. Users only need to describe the intended DAO market cap at different stages. Then, a bonding curve-based smart contract can be deployed immediately, at no cost.

3. Challenges

    Most existing DAO projects are using Liquidity Pool or NFT based principles for governance. However, bonding curve could be the optimal way for DAO launching as proved by constitution DAO, Assange DAO. Governance token based on bonding curve lacks sufficient community support, which prevents users from diving deep into this type of AMMs.

    Hotpot aims to help users learn and launch bonding curve-based tokens through artificial intelligence-powered interactive sessions, and provide them similar swaps functionality as Uniswap.


# Milestones

## Milestone 1 (Proof-of-concept stage/Hackathon Stage)

- Deadline: April/May 2022
- Description: The first stage (Proof-of-concept stage/Hackathon Stage), we will provide the community a basic version of product, where only core functionalities has been implemented. To be more specific, we will achieve the following goals
    
  - [x] User is capable to launch DAO tokens (based on bonding curve) using our platform
  - [x] Anyone can purchase/sell DAO tokens using swap interface on our platform
  - [x] UI design

## Milestone 2 (beta test stage)
- Deadline: June/July 2022
- Description: In this stage, we will focus on building the whole pipeline of DAO launching, including but not limited to
  - [ ] more complex DAO token launching strategy to meet requirement of different type of DAOs
  - [ ] provide users with one-click DAO tools configuration, such as token-gated discord, snapshot, etc.
  - [ ] DAO management dashboard: DAO owners can add more DAO information and DAO tools to their DAO pages.

## Milestone 3 (Official Launch)
- Deadline: August/September 2022
- Description: In this stage, we will focus more on the beta test with some communities, as well as security improvement by conducting smart contract auditing. We will achieve the following goals
  - [ ] complete the smart contact audit
  - [ ] launch DAOs on our platform by collaborating with different communities.

# Team
Our previous achievements inside polkadot ecosystem including but not limited to
 - [x] Delivered presentation at Polkadot decoded 2019 and being selected as finalist for polkadot decoded conference 2022
 - [ ] Successfully completed multiple grants from Polkadot ecosystem
 - [ ] Rich experience in web3.0 development

We have a dream. We are here, in the territory of Web3.0, only for three purposes. Fair, fair, and fucking fair.
