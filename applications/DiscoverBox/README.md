### Ecosystem Fit

GameFi has been popular all over the world starting in 2021. However, GameFi's gas fee on the Ethereum network is very expensive. For example, the popular Axie Infinity initially used Ethereum as its main chain, but later migrated to its self-built side chain due to high gas fees and delay problems. Secondly, GameFi has become a paradise for programmers and robots to make money, losing its fairness.

We want to make a cheaper, fairer, faster and safer GameFi product. Itâ€™s a good choice for our game deployed on Acala EVM+.
