## Project Overview ðŸ“„

### Overview

MetaDefender is a one-stop insurance that protects cross-chain diverse digital assets (including general tokens and NFTs), and provides 
financial products with contractual security. The project adopts the upgraded constant product model version 2.0, which fully aggregates 
the depth and liquidity of the insurance capital pool. The premium pricing is more reasonable and market-oriented, and the underwriters 
and policyholders have transparent funds and can withdraw freely. And the capital utilization rate is higher, and capital certificates can 
participate in liquidity mining to maximize profits.

At present, the project has completed the development of 90% of the front-end and smart contract, and completed the internal test on the
Ethereum test network, and obtained the demo version that can be used for trial.

### Project Details

- Detailed description of the core functiona of the project:

  Upgraded constant product model version 2.0 and higher capital utilization

- Project deployment step instructions: 

  May 2022 IDO starts.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
  
  There are already many insurance programs that cover homogeneous digital assets, but increasingly valuable NFT assets have yet to receive any technical 
  or institutional protection. Meanwhile, attacks on high-value NFT assets continue to prolifire.

  We want to build a protocol based on the Acala blockchain that can communicate and interact with parallel chains in the Polkadot ecosystem, accurately read 
  the security status of different assets in each chain, and allow participants of valuable assets -- whether they are the builder or the owner -- to build or 
  buy protection for them. And smart contracts ensure the fairness of protection mechanisms.

- What need(s) does your project meet?
  
  Currently, there are a variety of high-value assets distributed on different blockchains, and we provide a one-stop protection platform for them. Firstly, we 
  solve the dilemma that NFT assets are not insured, and secondly, users do not need to deploy insurance protocols separately on the chain where the assets are 
  located. It improves the depth and utilization of insurance capital.

- What makes your project unique?
  
  Upgraded AMM model makes everyone can buy any value of insurance policy anytime. Capital providers can also provide liquidity for more than 1 platform at one time.
